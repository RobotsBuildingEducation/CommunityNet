# NeoPets Collector

This project is a lightweight Nostr client focused on collecting and trading digital pets.

It demonstrates basic integration with [NIP-60](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/60.md) Cashu wallets and [NIP-61](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/61.md) Nutzaps.

Use the wallet hooks to store Cashu wallet data on relays and send Nutzap tokens to other users.
